		<p>Welcome to Arslin.com, the website for Arslin Inc. (”Arslin,” “we,” “us”, “the dealership”, or “our” ). The terms and conditions set forth herein are hereinafter referred to as the “Agreement” and govern all use of the Arslin.com website and all content, services, features, activities and products available at or through the website (collectively, the “Services”). This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms and conditions for your use of the website and the Services.
		</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<h3>1. Summary</h3>
		<p>Arslin is a vehicle buying service. We do not own any inventory. Instead, we are dedicated to locating and purchasing the best vehicle for you. Unlike conventional dealerships, the inventory offered here is virtualized and not available for viewing on or at the Arslin lot or location unless otherwise explicitly mentioned.</p>
		<p>These features are offered subject to certain restrictions, which are described further throughout this Agreement. Moreover, your use of Arslin's Services imposes certain obligations on you, which are described further below. Arslin strongly encourages you to read this Agreement in its entirety.</p>
		<h3>2. General Provisions</h3>

The Agreement consists of all terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, as well as those set forth in Arslin's Privacy Policy (https://www.Arslin.com/Privacy) and any Retail Installment Contract entered into between Arslin, on the one hand, and a buyer, on the other hand, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. All Services available at any time on this website are subject to this Agreement. Arslin reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time. Any such modification will be evidenced by a new effective date. All users of this website, including those who have previously acknowledged their acceptance of the Agreement, will be notified of any modification. Arslin may, in its unilateral discretion, change, restrict access to, suspend, or discontinue this website, or any portion thereof.</p>
		<h4>B. Intended Use</h4>

If you are accepting this Agreement on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the authority to do so.</p>

		<h3>3. Access and Use of the Services.</h3>
		<p>In order to use this website and access the Services, you must agree to our Terms and Conditions (https://www.arslin.com/terms) set form and also agree to our Privacy Policy (https://www.arslin.com/privacy). An account can be registered on the Arslin website or mobile application (the “Account”). You must provide accurate information and keep your Account information updated. You shall not: (i) select or use as a username a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use as a username a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization; or (iii) use, as a username, a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your Account, and for keeping your Account password secure. You may never use another person’s user account or registration information for the Services without permission. You must notify us immediately of any change in your eligibility to use the Services, breach of security or unauthorized use of your Account.</p>
		<h3>4. Buying and Selling Vehicles.</h3>
		<p>Arslin and or Arslin’s affiliates are licensed by the Florida and Georgia Department of Motor Vehicles as automotive dealerships. As explained more fully below, once a buyer has agreed to purchase a particular vehicle offered for sale on this website, Arslin and or Arslin’s affiliates purchases that vehicle from the seller (if Arslin and or Arslin’s affiliates does not otherwise own the vehicle). Thereafter, Arslin and or Arslin’s affiliates delivers the vehicle to our dealership location along with, title and, within Florida and Georgia, registration, to the buyer. At the time of delivery, (i) Arslin and or Arslin’s affiliates gives all required disclosures and notifications to the buyer, (ii) Arslin, and or Arslin’s affiliates, and the buyer mutually execute all required purchase and sale documents, and (iii) buyer pays Arslin and or Arslin’s affiliates for the vehicle.</p>
		<p>We may use a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill you or compensate you through a payment account linked to your Arslin account. The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. We are not responsible for error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to consummate a transaction with Arslin, you agree to pay us, through the Payment Processor, all charges in accordance with the applicable payment terms and you authorize us, through the Payment Processor, to charge or credit your chosen payment provider.</p>
		<h4>A. Buying a Vehicle on this Website.</h4>
		<p>Following registration for access and use of the Services, a prospective buyer is free to browse the website. For each vehicle offered for sale, the website displays professional photographs and certain characteristics of the vehicle. The photographs displayed may include both exemplars (where noted), but also photos of the actual vehicle offered for sale (where noted).</p>
		<p>The sale price at which Arslin offers a vehicle for sale on this website is fixed and not subject to negotiation. Prices on the website do not include sales or usage tax, delivery fees, title and registration fees, financing charges or extra purchases, including but not limited to an extended warranty. Please note because the vehicle offered for sale has not yet been purchased, certain disclaimers are made with regard to price – “market based pricing”. The pricing offered on this site is based on latest predictable market conditions for that vehicle, but in certain circumstances Arslin may be unable to obtain said vehicle at the recommended market price. In such event, Arslin may be unable to fill a vehicle order at that time.</p>
		<p>At the time a vehicle (along with title and, within Florida and Georgia, registration) is picked up or delivered to the buyer for consummation of a sale, the buyer and Arslin will mutually execute a Retail Installment Contract memorializing the terms of the sale. A buyer can pay for the vehicle by check, bank transfer, or arranged financing. Payment is due at the time of executing the Retail Installment Contract, and the buyer’s account will be charged immediately. If payment is by check, all checks will have to clear before delivery or pickup of vehicles. All vehicles delivered to a buyer will be free and clear of any liens previously attached to the vehicle. At the time of delivery, Arslin will give all required notifications and disclosures.</p>
		<p>While Arslin expects to be able to offer delivery within several days of most purchases, there are certain circumstances outside of Arslin’s control that may delay delivery. For example, if the transport truck is delayed outside of normal conditions, Arslin may be unable to deliver the vehicle in the original predicted timeframe. Accordingly, while Arslin makes every best effort to ensure a timely pickup or delivery, Arslin cannot offer a guaranteed delivery timeframe at the time of purchase.</p>

		<h4>A. Prohibited Actions.</h4>
		<p>You are solely responsible for your communications on and your use of the Services. You agree not to do any of the following: (A) post or transmit any libelous, defamatory, indecent, obscene, fraudulent, deceptive, abusive or pornographic message, data, image, content or program; (B) post or transmit any message, data, image, content or program that would violate any property rights of others; (C) use the Services to threaten, harass, or otherwise violate the legal rights (including rights of privacy and publicity) of others; (D) upload or download files that contain software, marks, logos, data, images, content or other material protected by intellectual property laws, rights of privacy or publicity, or any other applicable law, unless you own or control the rights to such files or material or have received all necessary consents; (E) upload files that contain a virus or corrupted data; (F) falsify the source or origin of software or other material contained in a file that you upload to the Services; (G) falsely purport to be an employee or agent of Arslin; (H) act, in your use of the Services, in a manner that is contrary to applicable law or regulation; or (I) circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Services or features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the Services or the content.</p>

		<h3>10. Dispute Resolution / Jurisdiction / Agreement to Arbitrate.</h3>
		<h4>A. In General.</h4>
		<p>Certain portions of this section are deemed to be a “written agreement to arbitrate” pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act. You and Arslin agree that we intend that this section satisfies the “writing” requirement of the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
		<h4>B. First -- Try to Resolve Disputes and Excluded Disputes.</h4>
		<p>If any controversy, allegation, or claim arises out of or relates to the Services, the content available through the Services, your User Submissions, or this Agreement (collectively, “Dispute”), then you and we agree to send a written notice to the other providing a reasonable description of the Dispute, along with a proposed resolution of it. Our notice to you will be sent to you based on the most recent contact information that you provide us. But if you have failed to provide us with this information or if such information is not current or accurate, then we have no obligation under this section. Your notice to us must be sent to: support@Arslin.com. For a period of 60 days from the date of receipt of notice from the other party, Arslin and you will engage in a good faith dialogue in order to attempt to resolve the Dispute, though nothing will require either you or Arslin to resolve the Dispute on terms with respect to which you and Arslin, in each party’s sole discretion, are not comfortable.</p>
		<h4>C. Forums for Alternative Dispute Resolution.</h4>
		<p>If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in above within 60 days of receipt of the notice (or, where no notice address exists for you, after such Dispute arises), then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this section.</p><p>Upon expiration of the applicable 60-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the then current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). If the Dispute has a claimed value of not more than $250,000, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than 10 years’ experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. If the Dispute has a claimed value of more than $250,000, or if Arslin elects in its sole discretion to bear the costs of arbitration in excess of those that would occur for a proceeding before a single neutral arbitrator, then the arbitration will be heard and determined by a three member panel, with one member to be selected by each party and the third (who will be chair of the panel) selected by the two party appointed members or by the AAA in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator or arbitration panel, as the case may be, will apply applicable law and the provisions of this Agreement, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award.</p>
		<p>If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within 60 days of the filing of a “demand for arbitration,” then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (“JAMS”) using JAMS’ streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer of Arslin consents to in writing. The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator and the $250,000 threshold for the number of arbitrators assigned to the Dispute set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another arbitration service.</p>
		<h4>D. Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution.</h4>
		<p>In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of this Agreement and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys’ fees). However, WITH ARBITRATION (i) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (ii) THE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (iii) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. All parties to the arbitration will have the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in San Mateo, Florida and Georgia; but if the applicable arbitration rules or laws require the arbitration to be conducted in the “metropolitan statistical area” (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration, Arslin shall have the right to elect to proceed to arbitration in such location. You and we will pay the administrative and arbitrator’s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require Arslin to pay a greater portion or all of such fees and costs in order for this section to be enforceable, then Arslin will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration. Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. The arbitrator’s decision must consist of a written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is based. Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration Act.</p>
		<h4>E. Limited Time to File Claims.</h4>
		<p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IF YOU OR WE WANT TO ASSERT A DISPUTE AGAINST THE OTHER, THEN YOU OR WE MUST COMMENCE IT (BY DELIVERY OF WRITTEN NOTICE AS SET FORTH ABOVE, WHERE FEASIBLE) WITHIN 1 YEAR AFTER THE DISPUTE ARISES -- OR IT WILL BE FOREVER BARRED.</p>
		<h4>F. Injunctive Relief.</h4>
		<p>The foregoing provisions of this section will not apply to any legal action taken by Arslin to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in connection with any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Services, the content available through the Services, your User Submissions and/or Arslin’s intellectual property rights, Arslin’s operations, and/or Arslin’s products or services.</p>
		<h4>G. Small Claims Matters Are Excluded from Arbitration Requirement.</h4>
		<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, either of us may bring a qualifying claim of Disputes in small claims court.</p>
		<h4>H. No Class Action Matters.</h4>
		<p>You and we expressly agree that any Dispute is personal to us, and any such Dispute shall only be resolved by an individual arbitration. Neither party agrees to class arbitration, or an arbitrationwhere a person brings a Dispute as a representative of any other person or persons. Neither you nor we agree that a Dispute can be brought as a class or representative action outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other person or persons. The parties agree that a Dispute may only be resolved through an individual arbitration and shall not be brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any other representative proceeding.</p>
		<h4>I. Federal and State Courts.</h4>
		<p>Except to the extent that arbitration is required above, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute may only be instituted in state court in Dade County, Florida or federal court in Miami, Florida. Accordingly, you and Arslin consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.</p>
		<h4>J. Applicable Law.</h4>
		<p>This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with, and any Dispute and Excluded Dispute will be resolved in accordance with, the laws of the State of Florida and Georgia, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>
		<h3>11. Usage and Ownership of Customer Information.</h3><p>All information submitted to Arslin through our website becomes and remains the property of Arslin.
