            PRIVACY POLICY FOR VOTE WITH VOICE'S ALEXA SKILLS
            This privacy policy governs your use of the software skills for Amazon Alexa and other
            similar platforms created by Vote With Voice (Skills). Current Skills are listed after
            the policy details, but new Skills will be added from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
            User Provided Information
            The Skills obtain the information you provide when you download and register
            the Skills through the Amazon Alexa skills web site, Facebook Messenger,
            or any other licensed source. Registration with Vote With Voice is not required
            at this time, although future enhancements may possibly require registration.
            In this latter case, please keep in mind that you may not be able to use some of the
            features offered by the Skills unless you register with us. Credit card information
            is not collected by any of these Skills at this time. Any information that you share
            with the online app store during purchase is held by that store and covered by its own
            privacy policy.
            We will not normally use any information you provide to us to contact you.
            Important information concerning required notices, upgrade and/or bug-fix notifications,
            or marketing promotions will normally be distributed by means of
            the Amazon Alexa skills site.
            Currently the Skills do not collect login information from and/or for social networking
            platforms. Any future enhancements which deliver this capability will be notified
            at the time of delivery or upgrade, and you may consent or opt-out at will.
        </p>
        <p>
            Automatically Collected Information
            In addition, the Skills may collect certain information automatically as part of normal
            operation within the context of the Amazon Alexa or Facebook Messenger environment,
            including, but not limited to, your hardware device unique ID, a unique user ID, your
            prior usage of the Skills, and information about the way you use the Skills.
            These Skills do not collect precise information about the location of your hardware device,
             though for details of information capture by the underlying platform each relevant terms
            and conditions agreement should be referenced.
        </p>
        <p>
            Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to Amazon's software
            environment and services to help us improve the Skills and our service. We will share your
            information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy
            statement. We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

            the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request; With our
            trusted services providers who work on our behalf, do not have an independent use of
            the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth
            in this privacy statement. If Vote With Voice is involved in a merger, acquisition,
            or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a
            prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of this information,
            as well as any choices you may have regarding this information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Automatic Data Collection and Advertising
            We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the Skills are being used,
            such as the frequency and duration of usage. To protect the anonymity of this information,
            we use an encryption technology to help ensure that these third parties can't identify
            you personally.
        </p>
        <p>
            What are my opt-out rights?
            You can stop all collection of information by the Skills easily by disabling the Skills
            on your Amazon Alexa account, or the equivalent action in Facebook Messenger.

            We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information
            we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized
            employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate,
            develop or improve our Skills. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide
            reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system
            can prevent all potential security breaches.
